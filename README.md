# DyKnow-Bypass
A DyKnow bypass. This is a dump of all the files I used to run the bypass. To use it yourself, install 32-bit python (I used 3.6), and run 

    python dyknowNameLogger.py
    
THIS IS A WHITELIST. This means that only the apps you specify will run. To modify, just edit `dyknowNameLogger.py` with whatever apps you want unblocked (must be allowed to execute already), and restart the script. To run this script, restart with airplane mode, log in and run the script from a command prompt. Then turn on wifi again and it will block DyKnow until either the next restart or until the script is stopped.
